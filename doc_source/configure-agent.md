# Create an AWS DataSync agent<a name="configure-agent"></a>

For AWS DataSync to access your self\-managed storage \(whether on\-premises or in the cloud\), you need a DataSync agent associated with your AWS account\. 

**Tip**  
An agent isn't required when transferring between AWS storage services in the same AWS account\. To set up a data transfer between two AWS services, see [Configure a source location](configure-source-location.md)\.
