# AWS DataSync network requirements<a name="datasync-network"></a>

Network requirements when using AWS DataSync depend on how you plan to transfer data \(for example, over the public internet or using a more private connection\)\.

## Network requirements for self\-managed storage systems<a name="on-premises-network-requirements"></a>

*Self\-managed storage* can refer to on\-premises or in\-cloud storage systems that you manage\. Transfers with these kinds of systems require using a DataSync agent\.

The following table lists the ports a DataSync agent needs open to access an Network File System \(NFS\) server, Server Message Block \(SMB\) server, object storage system that's compatible with the Amazon S3 API, or Hadoop Distributed File System \(HDFS\) cluster\.

**Note**  
Depending on your network, you might need to allow traffic on ports other than what's listed here for DataSync to connect with your self\-managed storage\.


| From  | To  | Protocol | Port  | How it's used by DataSync | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| DataSync agent  |  NFS server  |  TCP/UDP  |  2049  |  Mounts an NFS file system\.  DataSync supports NFS versions 3\.x, 4\.0, and 4\.1\.   | 
| DataSync agent  |  SMB server  |  TCP/UDP  |  139 or 445  |  Mounts an SMB file share\.  DataSync supports SMB versions 2\.1 and 3\.   | 
| DataSync agent  |  Object storage  |  TCP  |  443 \(HTTPS\) or 80 \(HTTP\)  |  Accesses your object storage\.   | 
| DataSync agent  | Hadoop cluster | TCP |  NameNode port \(default is 8020\) In most clusters, you can find this port number in the `core-site.xml` file under the `fs.default` or `fs.default.name` property \(depending on the Hadoop distribution\)\.   | Accesses the NameNodes in your Hadoop cluster\. Specify the port used when creating an HDFS location\. | 
| DataSync agent  | Hadoop cluster | TCP |  DataNode port \(default is 50010\) In most clusters, you can find this port number in the `hdfs-site.xml` file under the `dfs.datanode.address` property\.  | Accesses the DataNodes in your Hadoop cluster\. The DataSync agent automatically determines the port to use\. | 
| DataSync agent  | Hadoop Key Management Server \(KMS\) | TCP | KMS port \(default is 9600\) | Accesses the KMS for your Hadoop cluster\. | 
| DataSync agent  | Kerberos Key Distribution Center \(KDC\) server | TCP | KDC port \(default is 88\) | Authenticates with the Kerberos realm\. This port is used only with HDFS\. | 

## Network requirements for AWS storage services<a name="storage-service-network-requirements"></a>

The network ports required for DataSync to connect to an AWS storage service during a transfer vary\.


| From  | To  | Protocol | Port  | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| DataSync service |  Amazon EFS  |  TCP  |  2049  | 
| DataSync service |  FSx for Windows File Server  |  See [file system access control for FSx for Windows File Server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/limit-access-security-groups.html)\.  | 
| DataSync service |  FSx for Lustre  |  See [file system access control for FSx for Lustre](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/limit-access-security-groups.html)\.  | 
| DataSync service | FSx for OpenZFS |  See [file system access control for FSx for OpenZFS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/OpenZFSGuide/limit-access-security-groups.html)\.  | 
| DataSync service | FSx for ONTAP | TCP |  111, 635, and 2049 \(NFS\) 445 \(SMB\)  | 
| DataSync service | Amazon S3 | TCP | 443 \(HTTPS\) | 

## Network requirements for VPC endpoints<a name="using-vpc-endpoint"></a>

A virtual private cloud \(VPC\) endpoint provides a private connection between your agent and AWS that doesn't cross the internet or use public IP addresses\. This also helps prevent packets from entering or exiting the network\. For more information, see [Using AWS DataSync in a virtual private cloud](datasync-in-vpc.md)\.

DataSync requires the following ports for your agent to use a VPC endpoint\.


|  From  |  To  |  Protocol  |  Port  |  How it's used  | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
|  Your web browser   |  Your DataSync agent   |  TCP   |  80 \(HTTP\)   |  By your computer to obtain the agent activation key\. After successful activation, DataSync closes the agent's port 80\.  The DataSync agent doesn't require port 80 to be publicly accessible\. The required level of access to port 80 depends on your network configuration\.  Alternatively, you can obtain the activation key from the agent's local console\. This method does not require connectivity between the browser and your agent\. For more information about using the local console to get the activation key, see [Obtaining an activation key by using the local console](local-console-vm.md#get-activation-key)\.   | 
|  DataSync agent   |  Your DataSync VPC endpoint  To find the correct IP address, open the [Amazon VPC console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/), and choose **Endpoints** from the left navigation pane\. Choose the DataSync endpoint, and check the **Subnets** list to find the private IP address that corresponds to the subnet that you chose for your VPC endpoint setup\.   For more information, see step 5 in [Configuring DataSync to use private IP addresses for data transfer](datasync-in-vpc.md#create-agent-steps-vpc)\.   |  TCP  |  1024â€“1064   |  For control traffic between the DataSync agent and the AWS service\.  | 
| DataSync agent  |  Your task's network interfaces  To find the related IP addresses, open the Amazon EC2 console and choose **Network Interfaces** from the left navigation pane\. To see the four network interfaces for the task, enter your task ID in the search filter\.   For more information, see step 9 in [Configuring DataSync to use private IP addresses for data transfer](datasync-in-vpc.md#create-agent-steps-vpc)\.   |  TCP  |  443 \(HTTPS\)  |  For data transfer from the DataSync VM to the AWS service\.  | 
| DataSync agent  |  Your DataSync VPC endpoint  |  TCP  |  22 \(Support channel\)  |  To allow AWS Support to access your DataSync agent for troubleshooting\.  You don't need this port open for normal operation\.   | 

 The following diagram shows the ports required by DataSync when using VPC endpoints\.

## Network requirements for public or FIPS endpoints<a name="using-public-endpoints"></a>

Your agent VM requires access to the following endpoints to communicate with AWS when using public service endpoints, or when using FIPS endpoints\. Enabling this access is not necessary when using DataSync with VPC endpoints\. 

If you use a firewall or router to filter or limit network traffic, configure your firewall or router to allow these service endpoints\. They're required to enable outbound communication between your network and AWS\. 


|  From  |  To  |  Protocol  |  Port  |  How it's used  |  Endpoints accessed by the agent  | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
|  Your web browser   |  DataSync agent   |  TCP   |  80 \(HTTP\)   |  Used by your computer to obtain the agent activation key\. After successful activation, DataSync closes the agent's port 80\.  The DataSync agent doesn't require port 80 to be publicly accessible\. The required level of access to port 80 depends on your network configuration\.   Alternatively, you can obtain the activation key from the agent's local console\. This method does not require connectivity between the browser and your agent\. For more information about using the local console to get the activation key, see [Obtaining an activation key by using the local console](local-console-vm.md#get-activation-key)\.    | N/A | 
| DataSync agent  | AWS | TCP |  443 \(HTTPS\)  |  Used by the DataSync agent to activate with your AWS account\. You can block the public endpoints after activation\.  | For public endpoint activation: `activation.datasync.us-east-2.amazonaws.com` For FIPS endpoint activation: `activation.datasync-fips.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`  | 
|   DataSync agent   |  AWS   |   TCP   |   443 \(HTTPS\)   |  For communication between the DataSync agent and the AWS service endpoint\.

## Network interface requirements<a name="required-network-interfaces"></a>

For every task you run, DataSync automatically creates and manages [network interfaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html) for data transfer traffic\. How many network interfaces DataSync creates and where theyâ€™re created depends on the following details about your task:
+ Whether your task requires a DataSync agent\.
+ Your source and destination locations \(where youâ€™re copying data from and to\)\.
+ The type of endpoint used to activate your agent\.

Each network interface uses a single IP address in your subnet \(the more network interfaces there are, the more IP addresses you need\)\. Use the following tables to make sure your subnet has enough IP addresses for your task\.

### Transfers with agents<a name="transfers-with-agents-enis"></a>

You need a DataSync agent when copying data between a self\-managed storage system and an AWS storage service\.


| Location | Network interfaces created by default | Where network interfaces are created when using a public or FIPS endpoint | Where network interfaces are created when using a private \(VPC\) endpoint  | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
|  Amazon S3  | 4 | N/A \(network interfaces aren't needed because DataSync communicates directly with the S3 bucket\) |  The subnet you specified when activating your DataSync agent\.  | 
|  Amazon EFS  | 4 | The subnet you specify when creating the Amazon EFS location\. | 
| Amazon FSx for Windows File Server | 4 |  The same subnet as the preferred file server for the file system\.  | 
| Amazon FSx for Lustre | 4 | The same subnet as the file system\. | 
| Amazon FSx for OpenZFS | 4 | The same subnet as the file system\. | 
| Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP | 4 | The same subnet as the file system\. | 

### Transfers without agents<a name="transfers-without-agents-enis"></a>

You donâ€™t need a DataSync agent when copying data between AWS services\.

**Note**  
The total number of network interfaces depends on your DataSync task locations\. For example, transferring from an Amazon EFS location to FSx for Lustre requires four network interfaces\. Meanwhile, transferring from an FSx for Windows File Server to an Amazon S3 bucket requires two network interfaces\.


| Location | Network interfaces created by default | Where network interfaces are created | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  Amazon S3  |  N/A \(network interfaces aren't needed because DataSync communicates directly with the S3 bucket\)  | 
|  Amazon EFS  | 2 | The subnet you specify when creating the Amazon EFS location\. | 
| FSx for Windows File Server | 2 |  The same subnet as the preferred file server for the file system\.  | 
| FSx for Lustre | 2 | The same subnet as the file system\. | 
| FSx for OpenZFS | 2 | The same subnet as the file system\. | 
| FSx for ONTAP | 2 | The same subnet as the file system\. |
